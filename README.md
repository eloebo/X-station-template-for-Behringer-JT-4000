# X-station-template-for-Behringer-JT-4000

The goal with this template is to access most (if not all) of the JT-4000 midi CC parameters. All parameters except LFO are directly accessable to avoid menu-diving

20240216: Initial version, Not tested. (I suspect some stepsizes for buttons are wrong since they are not provided by Behringer)

Please test and leave suggestions or report bugs. Please fork from this repo if you continue development.
